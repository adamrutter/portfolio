Suzanne Hill School of Dance wanted a website that would help them attract new students, and provide helpful information to members.

They wanted the friendly atmosphere of the school to be a pronounced part of the website. It was important for me the website made the correct first impression, and the friendliness of the school was gotten across right away.

In pursuit of creating the right first impression, I used a warm, happy image for the homepage banner and ensured the first section of text addressed the friendly, supportive nature of the school.

The school also wanted potential new students to easily find information on classes, so I included a call-to-action button in the homepage banner. To ensure the user's attention is drawn here, the button is coloured a contrasting colour and I used leading lines within the hero image.

It was also paramount for the school that prospective new members could effortlessly get in contact. Links to the contact page are in the navbar, part way down the homepage, and also in a final contact call-to-action at the bottom of the homepage. The contact page itself includes multiple methods of communication, and there are contact details and social media links in the footer of every page.

The website is also for current members to find important information. Included in the navbar are links to the school's schedule, uniform and upcoming events, so they are always easily accessible.
