I wanted a tool to help me improve the readablility of text, and consistently layout elements in the browser, so I made Rhythm. It had to be responsive and account for different screen sizes.

Readability of text is essential to good web design; typographic elements need to have harmonious sizing and spacing, and be grouped logically, so they can be read easily and comfortably. Rhythm accordingly takes a systematic approach to size and layout.

Rhythm takes some user-defined values and uses formulas to size all type elements, at multiple breakpoints if required. It aligns these elements to a vertical grid, and provides helper functions to align any other elements to the grid.
