I specialise in developing fast, efficient, static websites. I use the static site generator Hugo and [my own boilerplate](https://github.com/adamrutter/hugo-boilerplate). In pursuit of this goal, I also:

- Write semantically correct HTML5 to deliver websites that are correctly structured and accessible.

- Write CSS using the Sass preprocessor, and use tools to ensure styling is consistent across all targeted browsers.

- Use JavaScript only where necessary, so my pages are as performant as possible, and transpile to make sure it works in all targeted browsers.

I deploy and host websites using Netlify. Git-based continuous deployment ensures the development/deployment cycle is fast, and their global CDN guarantees pages are loaded at high speed around the world.
